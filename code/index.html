    <h3>World Class Web Developer</h3>
    <p>A web developer is a programmer who specializes in, or is specifically engaged in, the development of World Wide Web applications using a client–server model. The applications typically use HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the client, PHP, ASP.NET (C#), Python, Go or Java in the server, and http for communications between client and server. A web content management system is often used to develop and maintain web applications.</p>

        <h3>My Dream</h3>
        <p>Dreaming big means having the mental freedom to think about what you really want out of life and forget about all the reasons why you can't make it a reality. It means having high standards for your life and setting the bar high for yourself.</p>

                Everyone has a story to tell—stories that will not only engage, inform, surprise, delight, and impact their audience, but that will also deliver inspiration to other which path to choose and why to choose the path in their professional life with proper evidence and experience. And I am one who always tries to explain things with data science, reference from the business perspective. That's why I choose the path of data science, machine learning, and ai as a biomedical, business, data analyst.

            <p>
                Currently, I am an undergraduate student of BUET working on some thesis projects related to data science, machine learning, and biomedical. Even, I have a good amount of knowledge in making decisions as I have a venture startup "KolpoBD" where we connect students to buy student equipment. My job is to make decisions for customers and vendors by analyzing from backend from our website.

                Rather, my goal is to do a Ph.D. in machine learning or data science from the USA or Canada, or Japan. After that always have a dream to build another startup related to machine learning along with my current venture kolpoBD.
